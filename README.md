DeeVee
==========

DeeVee is a web-based delta-V calculator for Kerbal Space Program. You can try it out [here](https://dkleto.github.io/deevee/app/).

To put it [simply](https://xkcd.com/1133/): DeeVee is a web page that lets you choose bits from Kerbal Space Program to build a flying space car. Pick the bits that you want to use and it will tell you if you will go to space today.

## Why not use a plugin to KSP?

There are of course a number of KSP plugins you could use ([Kerbal engineer](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-4-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-18-0), for example) which would accomplish the same thing in a much more comprehensive way from within KSP itself.

To me this felt a bit like cheating, but I was still getting tired of manually tapping the Tsiolkovksy equation into a scientific calculator. Writing my own program to handle the repetitive calculations, though - that's probably what NASA would do... right?

As it happened, I was looking for a chance to give Angular JS a try.

## Disclaimer, or whatever

The terms "Kerbal", "Space", and possibly "Program" belong to other people. I am not in any way associated with KSP or Squad (Beyond having devoted $30 of my money and numerous hours of my finite lifespan to their fantasy astronaut game).
